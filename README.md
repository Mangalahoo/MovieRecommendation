# MovieRecommendation

This is a data science project that generates the top 10 movie recommendations based on the name of a movie entered by the user. It uses machine learning models and movie datasets to suggest similar films. You can explore the code and try it out for yourself using the Jupyter notebook provided.

## Introduction
MovieRecommendation is designed to help users discover new movies similar to ones they have already enjoyed. By leveraging a dataset of movies and their attributes (such as genres, actors, and directors), the system identifies the top 10 movies most closely related to the movie entered by the user.

## Features
- Input a movie name and get top 10 movie recommendations.
- Designed for users looking for personalized movie suggestions.
- Employs machine learning techniques to analyze the similarities between movies.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Mangalahoo/MovieRecommendation.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd MovieRecommendation
    ```

3. Install the necessary dependencies using `requirements.txt`:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Open the Jupyter notebook:

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook MovieRecommendationSystem.ipynb
    ```

## Usage

1. Once you've launched the Jupyter notebook, open `MovieRecommendationSystem.ipynb`.
2. Run the notebook cells step by step to see how the model works and generate recommendations.
3. Input any movie name, and the system will output the top 10 recommended movies based on the input.

## Dataset
This project uses a dataset that includes information about various movies such as:
- Movie titles
- Genres
- Cast and crew
- Keywords
- User ratings

The dataset is processed to find relationships between different movies and to provide accurate recommendations.

## Recommendation System
The recommendation system employs a combination of:

- **Content-based filtering**: Analyzing movie metadata such as genre, director, cast, and keywords.
- **Similarity measures**: Cosine similarity is used to calculate the similarity between different movies, based on the vectorized movie features.
  
The model is designed to predict which movies are most similar to the one entered by the user and return a list of the top 10 recommendations.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning algorithms and models.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For running and demonstrating the project.

## Contributing
